# OPG Sirius

![Sirius logo](sirius-logo-v21.png "Sirius logo")

The Sirius system is the core case management system for the [Office of the Public Guardian](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-of-the-public-guardian). It is used by just over 1000 casework and customer service staff to administer Lasting Powers of Attorney and Supervision orders under the Mental Capacity Act of 2005. Sirius replaces two legacy case management systems, MERIS (LPA) and CASREC (Supervision). The input to SIRIUS is from scanned paper LPA and Supervision order applications and correspondence.

## What is the main purpose?

- To improve productivity and efficiency of casework;
- To reduce error in LPA and Supervision order processing;
- To offer scalability to cope with increasing demand;
- To mitigate failure of the historic systems;
- To facilitate better customer service;
- To ensure OPG can consistently fulfil its statutory function;
