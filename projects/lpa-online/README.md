# LPA Online Tool

LPA Online Tool is a GOV.UK web service available at https://www.lastingpowerofattorney.service.gov.uk/home.

> A lasting power of attorney (LPA) is a legal document that lets you (the 'donor') choose trusted people ('attorneys') to make decisions on your behalf.
> An LPA is mainly used if you don't have the mental capacity to make decisions yourself.
> You can only make an LPA for England and Wales – your LPA may not be recognised in other countries. There’s a different process in Scotland and Northern Ireland. You don’t need to be a British citizen or live in the UK to make an LPA.
